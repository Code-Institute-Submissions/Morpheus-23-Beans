The website is structured for absolute ease of use by new and existing members.  The site has a logical and easy flow, ensuring a positive user experience.  The structure was developed with that in mind.
- The initial website consists of:
    -   Welcome page - available to the public and giving basic information about the website
    -   Login page - to enable registered members to log into the website which will allow access to their own profile page, the all offers page and new offers page

        address, office address and available hours
    -   Profile page - reflects the registered user's username, firstname, surname, postal code and password. The registered user can change their password on this page, should they
        want / need to at any stage after their initial registration.

        only see the offers of the registered user, to clear the filters and to edit or delete their own offers.  Registered members do not have the option to delete or edit offers of other members. No edit or delete buttons appear on the offers of other members.

        category from the drop down list, thereafter provide an offer name, then a description of the offer, provide a collection address, collection date and there is an option to reflect the collection start time and expiry time.

### Surface

- The clickable logo and navigation bar is consistently located on each page, allowing an intuitive user experience
- The images shown on the site, reflects the Katwijk community, which images in itself will draw the community members in as they would be curious about the happenings in their  
  direct environment
- The layout has been kept very clean and simple as the site is aimed at absolutely all persons within the Katwijk community, young and old, from all backgrounds
- The colours taken from the Materialize Color Palette was also kept very simple and more shades of the same colors were used in stead of a greater variety of colours, also to keep
    the site looking calm and relaxing.  The colours were also chosen reflect the blue skye, green of the trees and the colours of the incredible blue and green building.

        "Cool colors include green, blue, and purple, are often more subdued than warm colors. They are the colors of night, of water, of nature, and are usually calming, relaxing, and somewhat reserved.

        Blue is the only primary color within the cool spectrum, which means the other colors are created by combining blue with a warm color (yellow for green and red for purple).

        Because of this, green takes on some of the attributes of yellow, and purple takes on some of the attributes of red. Use cool colors in your designs to give a sense of calm or professionalism." Taken from (https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/)
